# The Parks at 150

Our project celebrates the 150th anniversary of the U.S. National Parks with a series of interactive visualizations showcasing their popularity and biodiversity.

### Code and Data Sources
Our primary national park data (parks, species, visitation) is from the National Park Service. We also use images of the parks from Getty. Images of species were scraped from Google images using a separate Python script.

How to Run the Code:
For this project, we used WebStorm, however, any IDE can be used although directions may differ. Make sure all files are loaded into your IDE. To make sure that the HTML code is rendered properly in a production environment, we can preview the code. Begin by loading the index.html file. Then proceed to the View Tab. Hover over the Open in Browser option and select which browser you would like to open this project in. Our code is setup as a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript project, with the primary HTML file being `index.hmtl`. Everything needed to run the code is included in the repository.

All code is written by us, except for the libraries listed below.

Project Structure:
All the data required for the project is located in the /data folder. Most styling components are done in the files in /css folder, however, there were certain components where inline styling was used. All javascript files, which include separate .js components for each of our visualizations are located in the /js folder. The index.html folder contains the general structure of our website, and provides containers used for our visualization.

All data is included in the repository.
