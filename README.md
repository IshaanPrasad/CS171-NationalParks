# The Parks at 150

Our project celebrates the 150th anniversary of the U.S. National Parks with a series of interactive visualizations showcasing their popularity and biodiversity.

### Code and Data Sources
Our primary national park data (parks, species, visitation) is from the National Park Service. We also use images of the parks from Getty. Images of species were scraped from Google images using a separate Python script.

All data is included in the repository. 

Our code is setup as a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript project, with the primary HTML file being `index.hmtl`. Everything needed to run the code is included in the repository.

All code is written by us, except for the libraries listed below.
