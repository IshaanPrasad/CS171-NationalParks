# The Parks at 150: 
### Celebrating, Exploring, & Supporting Biodiversity within the U.S. National Parks

Throughout the world, environmental challenges threaten the existence of much of our planet’s biodiversity. In the U.S., the National Parks provide an excellent case study on how to protect the habitats of the nation’s most vulnerable species.

As frequent visitors to the Parks, we developed this data story to explore the characteristics of these protected areas, raise awareness of the species within them, and highlight opportunities for action.

As the Parks celebrate their 150th anniversary, we hope to support and celebrate the biodiversity within them for generations to come.

### Code and Data Sources
Our primary national park data (parks, species, visitation) is from the National Park Service. We also use images of the parks from Getty. Images of species were scraped from Google images using a separate Python script.

How to Run the Code:
For this project, we used WebStorm, however, any IDE can be used although directions may differ. Make sure all files are loaded into your IDE. To make sure that the HTML code is rendered properly in a production environment, we can preview the code. Begin by loading the index.html file. Then proceed to the View Tab. Hover over the Open in Browser option and select which browser you would like to open this project in. Our code is setup as a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript project, with the primary HTML file being `index.hmtl`. Everything needed to run the code is included in the repository.

Project Structure:
The root folder contains the general structure of our website, and provides containers used for our visualization. All the data required for the project is located in the /data folder. All javascript files, which include separate .js components for each of our visualizations are located in the /js folder. 

All data is included in the repository. All code is written by us, except for the libraries listed below.
