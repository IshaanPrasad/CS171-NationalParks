# CS171-NationalParks

How to Run the Code:
For this project, we used WebStorm, however, any IDE should can be used although directions may differ. Make sure all files are loaded into your IDE. To make sure taht the HTML code is rendered properly in a production environemnt, we can preview the code. Begin by loading the index.html file. Then proceed to the View Tab. Hover over the Open in Browser option and select which browser you would like to open this project in.


Libraries Used:
D3 was used for the visualizations. Bootstrap was used for design of the web components. Leaflet was used for one of our map visualizations (Visualization No. 1). The National Park Service API was also used in order to get data that was required for some of the visualizations we made. The fullpage.js library was used to structure our website and offer more styling.

Project Structure:
All of the data required for the project is located in the /data folder. Most styling components are done in the files in /css folder, however, there were certain components where inline styling was used. All javascript files, which include separate .js components for each of our visualizations are located in the /js folder. The index.html folder contains the general structure of our website, and provides containers used for our visualization.
